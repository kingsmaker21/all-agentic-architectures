        "# 📘 Agentic Architectures 1: Reflection\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first notebook in our deep dive into the 21 key agentic architectures. We begin with one of the most fundamental and powerful patterns: **Reflection**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This pattern elevates a Large Language Model (LLM) from a simple, single-pass generator into a more deliberate and robust reasoner. Instead of just providing the first answer it comes up with, a reflective agent takes a step back to critique, analyze, and refine its own work. This iterative process of self-improvement is a cornerstone of building more reliable and higher-quality AI systems."

      "source": [
        "### Definition\n",
        "The **Reflection** architecture involves an agent critiquing and revising its own output before returning a final answer. Instead of a single-pass generation, it engages in a multi-step internal monologue: produce, evaluate, and improve. This mimics the human process of drafting, reviewing, and editing to catch errors and enhance quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### High-level Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Generate:** The agent produces an initial draft or solution based on the user's prompt.\n",
        "2.  **Critique:** The agent then switches roles to become a critic. It asks itself questions like: *\"What could be wrong with this answer?\"*, *\"What is missing?\"*, *\"Is this solution optimal?\"*, or *\"Are there any logical flaws or bugs?\"*.\n",
        "3.  **Refine:** Using the insights from its self-critique, the agent generates a final, improved version of the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use / Applications\n",
        "*   **Code Generation:** The initial code might have bugs, be inefficient, or lack comments. Reflection allows the agent to act as its own code reviewer, catching errors and improving style before presenting the final script.\n",
        "*   **Complex Summarization:** When summarizing dense documents, a first pass might miss nuances or omit key details. A reflection step helps ensure the summary is comprehensive and accurate.\n",
        "*   **Creative Writing & Content Creation:** The first draft of an email, blog post, or story can always be improved. Reflection allows the agent to refine its tone, clarity, and impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths & Weaknesses\n",
        "*   **Strengths:**\n",
        "    *   **Improved Quality:** Directly addresses and corrects errors, leading to more accurate, robust, and well-reasoned outputs.\n",
        "    *   **Low Overhead:** It's a conceptually simple pattern that can be implemented with a single LLM and doesn't require complex external tools.\n",
        "*   **Weaknesses:**\n",
        "    *   **Self-Bias:** The agent is still limited by its own knowledge and biases. If it doesn't know a better way to solve a problem, it can't critique its way to a better solution. It can fix flaws it recognizes but can't invent knowledge it lacks.\n",
        "    *   **Increased Latency & Cost:** The process involves at least two LLM calls (generation + critique/refinement), making it slower and more expensive than a single-pass approach."

        "The LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation provides quantitative evidence of the reflection pattern's success. The initial draft likely received a high score for correctness but a very low score for efficiency. In contrast, the refined code would have scored highly on both correctness and efficiency. This automated, scored evaluation confirms that the reflection process didn't just change the code—it demonstrably *improved* it in a measurable way."

        "In this notebook, we have successfully built, executed, and evaluated a complete, end-to-end agent using the **Reflection** architecture with Nebius AI Studio models. We have seen firsthand how this simple yet powerful pattern can transform a basic LLM generator into a more sophisticated and reliable problem-solver.\n",
        "\n",
        "By structuring the process into distinct **Generate**, **Critique**, and **Refine** steps and orchestrating them with LangGraph, we created a robust system that can identify and correct its own significant flaws. The tangible improvement—from an inefficient recursive solution to an optimal iterative one—demonstrates that reflection is a foundational technique for moving beyond trivial agentic tasks and building AI systems that exhibit a deeper level of quality and deliberation."
